<h1> <marquee>  WHAT IS WEB DESIGNING </marquee> </h1> 
          <pre> <big> <b> Web Designing </b> refers to the process of creating the visual layout and user experience of websites. 
                 It involves both the <b> aesthetic design </b>(how the website looks) and the <b> Functional design</b>(how the website works and responds to users). 

     Some examples of these skills are information architecture, user interface, site 
      structure, navigation, layout, colours, fonts and overall imagery. All of these skills are 
      combined with the principles of design to create a website that meets the goals of the 
      company or individual from whom that site is being created. </big>
